Tools for interacting with web interfaces
=========================================
These tools use PhantomJS to run as client side javascript

* officejet
  A tool that lets you use the HP Officejet (e.g. 7500) embedded web
  server to scan a page and save it as a png. Sadly this cannot be done
  as easily with curl since it only supports scanning to the web page
  as an embedded image then using the browsers save from there.
