Farley Personal Assistant
=========================

A framework for an interactive personal assistant to help organize
one's knowledge and automate tasks.

This is a reboot of an old *neglected experimental pet project* in a
new language in its *infancy*. I'm sharing to be able to discuss with
friends and although there isn't anything private or special here. If
you stumble across this by way of common interests such as using a
common framework (e.g. opennlp, jena, etc.) then feel free to drop me
a note if you have suggestions of things to change or look at.
